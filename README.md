# Glucose-Monitoring-Prediction
This project predicts glucose levels using machine learning on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. Features like age, BMI, insulin, and blood pressure are analyzed. A Random Forest model with visual insights supports early diabetes detection, personalized healthcare, and potential real-time integration in health monitoring applications.
